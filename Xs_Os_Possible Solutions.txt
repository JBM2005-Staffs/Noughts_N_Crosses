Storing the actual ASCII Grid is the bit that is going to be the most difficult to work out 

The values themselves is done with bools
18 of them all in the array
This way we know not only whether a pos is filled but who filled it
Possibly we need to make a dynamic grid or we need to create an ascii grid for every single possibility
